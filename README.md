This repository contains the source code for my React Change Calculator.

Objectives:

- Become more comfortable with a more modern JavaScript syntax, ES6+.
- Understand Model-View-Controller architecture.
- Familiarize myself with the popular front-end library, React.

The purpose of this project was to identify and create all the different components, establish an interactive user interface and then handle all the failures, crashes, and bugs.

Steps Taken:

1. Clone a set of files from GitHub.
2. Convert a visual wireframe to JSX markup.
3. Set up state management.
4. Set up event binding for the button element.
5. Update the view state based on the calculation result.
6. Show the state values in the DOM.
